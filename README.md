# meshy

Using a raspberry pi 2 with TL-wn722n adapter and a grovepi kit for the display. Software is hsmm-pi.

Run meshy.py on boot and it will scan for and log contact with mesh networks. It will also try to resolve
and cache network names (callsigns) for use later. I will add the ability to store gps coordinates and 
do some analysis on the logs later on.
